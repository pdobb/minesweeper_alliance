# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

  tooltips:
    bbbv: The 3BV Value (a.k.a. BBBV) of a board represents the minimum number of clicks required to solve it (without placing any flags and without chording). Higher value = greater solve difficulty.
    bbbvps: 3BV/s grades solve speed based on the 3BV (ideal solve) value for a specific board. Higher is better.
    chords: Chords are groups of cells that are automatically revealed by clicking on a previously revealed cell (number) for which the corresponding number of surrounding cells have been flagged.
    clicks: Clicks = Reveals + Chords + Flags Placed + Flags Removed
    efficiency_html: Efficiency measures the ratio of actual clicks to the ideal/minimal clicks<span class="font-sans">&mdash;</span>as defined by the board's 3BV value. Fewer clicks = higher efficiency. Efficiencies over 100% are possible when chording.
    reveals: Reveals are regular left-clicks on unrevealed cells. Clicking a previously revealed cell doesn't count against total clicks.
    score: Score = solve speed in seconds. Lower is better.
