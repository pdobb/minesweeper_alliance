# Game represents a game of Minesweeper Alliance. Game play is kept as close to
# that of the original Microsoft Minesweeper game as possible, while adding a
# real-time, collaborative multiplayer element to it.
#
# Game is the top-most model in the object graph that's driving the overall
# gameplay flow--from new game creation to game end. The current Game "state"
# is stored by {Game#status}, and is described by the lifecycle states:
# - "Standing By",
# - "Sweep in Progress", and either
# - "Alliance Wins" or "Mines Win"
#
# Typical flow for Game creation/start is:
# 1. Build a new Game (`Game.build_for(settings: <Board::Settings>)`),
# 2. Which builds an associated {Board} (storing off the given {Board::Settings}
#    object into {Board#settings} as a serialized Hash).
# 3. Generate an associated 1-dimensional Array of {Cell}s of length
#    {Board#width} * {Board#height}--filling in {Cell#coordinates} for each,
#    based on its Array index (see {Board::Generate#build_coordinates_for}).
# 4. Atomically save all of the above to the database, while also setting the
#    lifecycle state of the Game ({Game#status}) to "Standing By" (i.e. awaiting
#    the first {Cell#reveal} of the Game).
#
# Later, when a player clicks to reveal a {Cell} in the first round of the
# game:
#  1. Randomly mark {Cell#mine} = `true` from among the associated Array of
#     {Board#cells}.
#    - Note: We ensure that the first-revealed Cell of the game (a.k.a. the
#      "Seed Cell") is excluded from this mine-placing randomization so that the
#      first {Cell#reveal} of the Game is, in effect, always safe.ยบ
#    - The number of mines to be placed comes from the stored {Board#settings},
#      as may be expected.
#  2. Start the Game (i.e. transition to lifecycle state: "Sweep in Progress").
#  3. Reveal the first-clicked-on {Cell}, following the general rules of
#     Minesweeper gameplay from there.
#
#  ยบ EXCEPTION: In the case of a "Pattern" Game board, mines are specifically
#    placed after step 4 in the "Typical flow for Game creation/start", above.
#    Which means that the first {Cell#reveal} of the Game for a "Pattern" Game
#    board is *not* safe and *can* end the Game in defeat, straight away.
#
# @attr status [String] The current Game status / life-cycle state.
# @attr type [String] The preset or Game type used to generate this Game's
#   {Board} / {Grid} of {Cell}s.
#   Note: This attribute/column is *not* used for STI.
# @attr started_at [DateTime] When this Game started. i.e. transitioned from
#   {#status} "Standing By" to "Sweep in Progress". This is a cached version of
#   the associated {GameStartTransaction#created_at} value.
# @attr ended_at [DateTime] When this Game ended. i.e. transitioned from
#   {#status} "Sweep in Progress" to either "Alliance Wins" or "Mines Win".
#   This is a cached version of the associated {GameEndTransaction#created_at}
#   value.
# @attr score [Integer] The play-time in seconds of a victorious Game. Maxes out
#   at {MAX_SCORE} (999).
# @attr bbbv [Integer] The 3BV value for the associated, solved {Board}.
# @attr bbbvps [Float] The 3BV/s rating of a solved {Board}.
# @attr efficiency [Float] The ratio of actual clicks vs necessary clicks (3BV)
#   used to solve the associated {Board}.
