      Mobile support seems<span class="font-sans">&hellip;</span> lacking?
    </h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3 list-[circle] ml-7">
      <li>
        This game relies on left-click, right-click, mouse-down, and mouse-up events <span class="text-gray-500 dark:text-neutral-400">(for revealing cells, placing flags, highlighting neighboring cells, and revealing neighboring cells (chording) / clearing highlights, respectively)</span>. Unfortunately, mobile browser support for any of these other than "left-click" is poor. A future "flag toggle" mode could allow for placing flags, but may be a bit cumbersome. As a result, our primary focus for mobile thus far has just been to allow for following along with the action.

        Note: The grid is transposed to better fit on mobile displays as needed<span class="font-sans">&mdash;</span>when it is wider than it is tall (and when<span class="font-sans">&hellip;</span> other<span class="font-sans">&hellip;</span> conditions allow for it ðŸ˜‰).
